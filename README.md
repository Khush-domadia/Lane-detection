ðŸš— Lane Detection System
This repository contains a Lane Detection System that identifies lanes in a video or image feed. It features a web-based front-end to showcase the detection results and the ratio of detected lanes. The back-end uses Python with the OpenCV library for lane detection.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Front-End Website:

Displays detection results.
Shows the ratio of detected lanes for better analysis.
Back-End:

Developed in Python.
Utilizes the OpenCV library for image and video processing.
Detects lanes in real-time or from pre-recorded inputs.

ðŸš€ How It Works

Input:
Video feed or images are passed into the backend.
Sample videos are provided in the media/ folder.

Lane Detection:
The Python backend processes the input using OpenCV to detect lanes.
Detected lanes are overlaid on the original input.

Output:
The front-end website displays:
Video/image results with detected lanes.
Detection ratio (percentage of lanes successfully detected).

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
Python (Backend)
OpenCV (Computer Vision)
HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Front-End)

ðŸ”§ Future Improvements
Real-time lane detection using webcam feeds.
Lane curve prediction for autonomous driving systems.
Integration of a Flask/Django server to connect front-end with backend dynamically.
